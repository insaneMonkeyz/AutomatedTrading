1) after sending an order we receive a callback with result of that transaction but TransactionId is not provided so we can't find the order that was executed
2) double caching when new entity is received
3) double rounding error spotted in USDRUBF price 81.74999 instead of 81.75
4) transactionId not saved in cache for reused orders (move/cancel)
